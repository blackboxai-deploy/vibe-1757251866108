## SaaS Data Entry App Implementation TODO

Based on the approved plan, here are the logical steps to implement the app. I'll update this file as steps are completed.

- [x] Install dependencies: Run `pnpm add @clerk/nextjs xlsx` and `pnpm add -D @types/node` (already present)
- [ ] Create authentication setup files:
  - [ ] src/app/layout.tsx (with ClerkProvider and basic layout)
  - [ ] src/middleware.ts (for protected routes)
  - [ ] src/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx (SignIn page)
  - [ ] src/app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx (SignUp page)
  - [ ] src/lib/auth.ts (role helper)
  - [ ] .env.local (with Clerk placeholders)
- [ ] Create frontend pages and components:
  - [ ] src/app/page.tsx (Home page)
  - [ ] src/app/dashboard/page.tsx (User dashboard with form and table)
  - [ ] src/app/admin/page.tsx (Admin panel with editable table)
  - [ ] src/components/DataForm.tsx (Reusable form)
  - [ ] src/components/EditableTable.tsx (Reusable editable table)
- [ ] Create backend API:
  - [ ] src/app/api/data/route.ts (CRUD endpoints)
- [ ] Initialize Excel file:
  - [ ] data.xlsx (empty with headers)
- [ ] Image Processing (AUTOMATIC)
  - [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) â†’ AI-generated images
    - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
    - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
    - Ensures all images are ready before testing
- [ ] Build the app: Run `pnpm run build --no-lint`
- [ ] Start the server: Run `pnpm start`
- [ ] Test APIs via curl and verify functionality
- [ ] Retrieve preview URL and present to user

Progress: 5% complete. Dependencies installed.
